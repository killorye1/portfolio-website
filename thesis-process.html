          <p>Black-Eyed Susans explores the culture of rock climbing from the perspective of a woman. Although rock climbing has a reputation of rebellion and freedom it is not unlike any other sport in that it is still male dominated. Being a climber myself, I’m inspired to share the stories of other women who came before me. However, since the majority of documentation and notariaty came from male climbers the historical accounts of the first women involved where often
          erased or dismissed. Mountaineering has come a long way and now it is a unique case where women have equal
          physical capability as their male counterparts, yet men still continue to participate in higher numbers. I
          want to provide role models for young girls and women to encourage them to get into the sport. The goal
          is to inform people on the achievements of women mountaineers as their stories were often forgotten by
          society.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
          I created illustrations, took photographs, and designed and developed a timeline of women and
          mountaineering. I am a highly motivated self starter and integrated HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and React into my senior project  to create
          a dashboard of Eileen Healey’s mountaineering diaries consisting of 26 volumes and over two hundred
          entries from 1932 to 1958. To my knowledge, no other data visualization of a person’s climbing career has
          previously existed and I feel proud to contribute to the documentation of Healey’s story.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>Even after the academic due date of this project I'm continuing to revise and create additions to this project. In the process of my thesis my curiousity was sparked to learn more about the various ways one can analyze and communicate a story with data. The programming language R looks like it can play a role in creating more user interaction and transparancy with data. Click the link below to visit the site.

    <h1>Photography</h1>
		          <p> I conducted interviews with female climbers to learn about their personal experiences participating in this activity and to see what was missing from the community. I wanted to find women of various backgrounds to see how that affects their understanding of climbing. From this information I gained an empathetic understanding of the users needs. I designed and developed an application that could help bring the community together and inspire others to join. I went to the cliff with a few of these women and had the opportunity to take photographs of this experience.</p>

          <h1>Visual Research & Illustration</h1>

          <p> I created a timeline of women mountaineers with historical context of the progression of women’s rights and technological advancements in climbing gear. To create a visually engaging design hand-crafted illustrations and a few silkscreen prints accompany the information on the timeline. Below are the sketches and final versions of the images.</p>

    <h1>Web Development</h1>
          <p> I also researched heavily into the climbing career of Eileen Healey. She was a climber very active during the 1930’s-1950’s. Unbeknownst to her family and friends she kept exceptionally detailed documentation of the majority of her expeditions in over 20 volumes of personal diaries. After her passing in 2010 her family discovered her writings in the attic of her home. They were then shared on http://www.alpine-club.org.uk/ were I gathered the data into a google sheet doc. After properly formatting the sheet I visualized it using google charts. Once I was satisfied with the data visualiztions I coded a dashboard using Bootstrap and React.JS to create a visually engaging and simplified look at Healey's climbing career</p>
